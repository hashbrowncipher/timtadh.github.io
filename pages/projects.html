    <p>I have worked on number of projects over the years. Here are some that I am
currently trying to find time to hack on.</p>
<h1>Netgrid</h1>
<p>Netgrid is a distributed map-reduce like computation platform. Written in Go it
supports iterative jobs which makes it more suitable for a variety of tasks. I
originally implemented it to support my research objectives in Frequent Subgraph
Mining. It is not currently open source but I am exploring the possibility.</p>
<h1>Slang</h1>
<p>Slang is a programming language which I have been working on to help me teach
the principles of compilation and program analysis. It is currently in an
unfinished state as it lacks many features I would like it to have the in the
future. However, it does demonstrate lexing, parsing, intermediate code
generation, control flow analysis, structural data flow analysis, and machine
code generation.</p>

<h1>File Structures</h1>
<p>One of my hobbies is writing database indices. This project collects the ones I
have written in Go together in one place. It includes: BTree, B+Tree with
duplicate key support, Linear Virtual Hashing, and a Blob store.</p>

<h1>PyFlowr</h1>
<p>A query language for Python Object Hierarchies. It is loosely inspired by
XQuery/XPath and OQL. It allows schema-less queries of complex Python
data structures. It is a fun little qtuery language with an easily extensible
parser for adding more syntax.</p>

<h1>Tree Edit Distance</h1>
<p>I have a great implementation of exact tree edit distance using the Zhang-Shasha
algorithm. People seem to email me fairly regularly about it so someone out
there is finding it useful.</p>

<h1>Command Line Utilities</h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timtadh/swork">swork</a> A shell environment manager. I use
   this to help manage all my projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timtadh/optutils">optutils</a> A python library to help me
   write command line utilities. I write a lot of these.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timtadh/passmash">passmash</a> A site specific password
   munger.</li>
<li>Lots of private little things here and there.</li>
</ol>

<h1>More on the github</h1>
<p>I have a lot more projects over on my github. These are just some of the
highlights. Beyond the github, there are my
