    <p>I available for consulting on a per project basis. I can also offer training
materials and sessions on a number of topics.</p>
<h1>Parsing</h1>
<p>Do you have a complex language which needs to be parsed? Don't have the in house
skill set or the time? Then let's work together on your parsing problem! I have
written many parsers from scratch as well as implemented regular expression
engines and general parsing frameworks. Contracts are negotiated on a per
project basis depending on the complexity of the project.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>I also have a variety of training materials ready to help your developers get up
to speed on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lexical analysis with regular expressions</li>
<li>Lexical analyzer engine implementation</li>
<li>Context Free Grammars</li>
<li>Top Down Parsing</li>
<li>Table Driven Top Down Parsing</li>
<li>Bottom Up Parsing with Yacc and Yacc like systems</li>
<li>Intermediate Representations with Abstract Syntax Trees</li>
</ol>

Go since its first public release (2009). I have implemented a number of systems
including: web services, databases, gui programs, deployment management systems,
compilers, machine learning algorithms, etc...</p>
